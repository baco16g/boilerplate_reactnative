## Outline

This repository is boilerplate for React-Native that does not depend on Expo.

However, I think that it is better to use Expo.

## Usage

```zsh
# package install
$ npm install

# react-native upgrade
$ npm run upgrade

# edit this project name in package.json
$ vi package.json
```

Should not overwrite `.gitignore`.
